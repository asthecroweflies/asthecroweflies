[Yesterday, 6:43 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	Are you writing the code for the matrix :steammocking:
	but seriously is that the work you have been doing

[Yesterday, 7:00 PM]
mmmeh:
	im trying to close the gap between the blue and orange series
	https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1624066703067929089/C98924488985E033656C3A39BE61088CBFFC06BC/

	there's a region in the pacific ocean whose surface temperatures can tell us if there's an el niño event

	we're looking at nino 3.4
	we're using temperatures from 112 climate models though for some bizarre ass reason some models are warmer for me
	than for my adviser and i literally do not know why
	some noise is fine but i need the trend to agree

[Yesterday, 7:02 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	Damn man. You weren’t kidding about the big brain

[Yesterday, 7:02 PM]
mmmeh:
	spent  8 hours on this today and im p sure i made the code even worse lol

[Yesterday, 7:02 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	this is interesting

[Yesterday, 7:02 PM]
mmmeh:
	goinna go for a bike ride to clear my head a bit
	i'm almost certain it's something really really simple
	bc i've like quintuple checked the logic in every step

[Yesterday, 7:02 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	It always is in code

[Yesterday, 7:03 PM]
mmmeh:
	and it works well for the other models it's just some that it messes up

[Yesterday, 7:03 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	most of the time

[Yesterday, 7:03 PM]
mmmeh:
	hmm
	that is an interesting point
	supposing my code works like it should,
	if the data im using
	is at all different than what my adviser has that would explain it.. i'll look into this when i get back
	u mighta just helped me solve the mystery lol

[Yesterday, 7:04 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	Lol
	I think you misunderstood me
	But Yay me!?
	damn I’m impressed though, your going to do great things in life

[Yesterday, 8:55 PM]

[Yesterday, 11:24 PM]
mmmeh:
	for some reason i win more often with the chewy knockoff controller
	but the xbone just feels so much better

[Yesterday, 11:24 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	Haha really

[Yesterday, 11:25 PM]
mmmeh:
	ya i imagine it comes down to my ability to just hit the ball straight, usually when i whiff i roll to the side for some reason
	i bet ur pc is running smooth as butter with manjaro

[Yesterday, 11:25 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	me too

	Everything is just right there you know?
	Settings arent hidden behind bullshit

[Yesterday, 11:26 PM]

Entancedpoet:

Entancedpoet:
	Yeah except linux customisation can be a deep rabbit hole

[Yesterday, 11:47 PM]
Entancedpoet:

[Yesterday, 11:48 PM]
mmmeh:

[Yesterday, 11:49 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	In the eventide Squinting upon the crimson skyConfounding me my eyesBeheld a kingdom riseHow can it beThat any waking eye may seeThe eventide conceiveA kingdoms riseFrom sea to skiesWhat woe it is to seeAnd indeed to knowA hand so bold To hold a candle to the sky Just to show it's glowThe shadow now shownA kingdom of stone
	Rough draft

[Yesterday, 11:51 PM]
mmmeh:
	oof dat rhythm
	flowing like deep river
	1 thing, i think the 3rd to last line should have "its" and not "it's"
	i could really taste this piece, nicely done

[Yesterday, 11:52 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	I just had to type it out lol rough dragy
	draft

[Yesterday, 11:53 PM]
mmmeh:
	yus such is the role of the draft to be revised and refined like a gem

[Yesterday, 11:53 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	So you dug it?
	It felt very original when i looked at it

[Yesterday, 11:56 PM]
mmmeh:
	yes it was rich with imagery
	and there's several layers to it so the immediate meaning is not revealed to the reader

[Yesterday, 11:57 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	Then I suppose i did my job then :steamhappy:
	1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed - Wikipedia
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1177_B.C.:_The_Year_Civilization_Collapsed

	I was somewhat inspired by this amazing book
	A really great read

[Yesterday, 11:59 PM]
mmmeh:
	o damn
	the fact that it's non-fiction makes it all the more moving

Wednesday, September 9, 2020

[12:01 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Inspired among other things as well, but if you got time id def recommend this book. Its interesting how the  myth and history shadow one another. Such as the trojan war and exodus
	Im glad you liked the poem though

[12:32 AM]
mmmeh:
	surely u have made more though
	:greenfrog:

[12:52 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Yes but I lost notebooks of them though
	ALOT

[12:57 AM]
mmmeh:
	aw dang
	well that means you better make more :]

[12:57 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Yeah do you write

[1:03 AM]
mmmeh:
	mmmm
	just papers heh
	i mean i have some ideas for poems but i haven't roped down the right words yet

[2:05 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	It’s tough to get into the groove
	The serpent looked into my eyes Spoke the greatest truth  And the greatest lie After its skin had shed It began to swallow its tail With a crooked smile, he spoke ”Thus is my beauty and my horror The majesty of my triumph And my tragedy The deceiving and my believing My nature’s clear.  Becoming clearer That I am the fear of the mirror.”
	I for some reason remember that one
	I wrote it when I was 17

[2:08 AM]
mmmeh:
	fear of the mirror
	got damb
	you have the poet's ear

[2:10 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	What do you think? I hardly remember writing it but
	It’s kind of funny that Xbox live assigned me the name Entrancedpoet lol
	You down for a game

[2:11 AM]
mmmeh:
	i think it has shining qualities
	especially for being written at 17
	and nop im prettty much useless in RL atm at this hour
	cant sleep so ive been workin on a battle feature for my discord bot

[2:12 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	haha me too
	hows ur kitty doing

[2:12 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol she knotty
	i find when she eats a lot
	she wants even more all the time
	and really wont let up until she gets some
	idk if i told you but this morning i went out for bagels on my bike after feeding her
	but i forgot i left the bag out
	and when i came back she had torn a hole in it and was goin ham on a dry food buffet

[2:14 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Calculated.

[2:14 AM]
mmmeh:
	lmao :steamfacepalm:

[2:14 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Red laser pointers help
	distracts them for a while
	and its good for kicks

[2:14 AM]
mmmeh:
	yus
	she also LOVES string
	like it's like instant cat nip
	she has to chase and bite it
	i can be pretty quick with it tho and can yoink it out of her reach like 8/10 times
	i can tell she gets annoyed and really goes hard to get it
	also does ur cat just randomly get the zoomies
	like around 9am every day she just starts sprinting
	and jumping up corners it's really funny
	lasts for like 5min and she's chill again

[2:17 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Yeah it happens
	Except my cat does it at like 4 am
	My cat is the biggest troll

[2:18 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol cheeky bugger

[2:18 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	He loves to meow at me endlessly

[2:21 AM]
mmmeh:
	hmmmmm ok so im not alone
	i tried conditioning her that if she meows at me
	im gonna pick her up and cuddle
	but for an uncomfortably long time
	so she wriggles out of my grip
	to get her to not meow so much, but she just runs after meowing when she sees me get up lol

[2:26 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	https://steamusercontent-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1620689054057343797/418FA87F2DD017228DB478A75F14A15A6C325DA8/

	Thats what i try
	Just meow back
	And I think they get confused after a while
	My cats like that to
	But cats are fickle little things

[2:29 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol wat a floof ball
	how old is he?
	i feel like im probably a bit impatient, my chungy is only 2 so she's gonna be a bit rebellious

[2:30 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	He’s like 8
	i think

[2:30 AM]
mmmeh:
	o he's like 40 in human years then

[2:30 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	She will figure out eventually that you can’t always get what ya want
	but if you try some times
	You’ll find you get what you need
	yeah I just busted out some Rolling Stones :steammocking:

[2:32 AM]
mmmeh:
	u might just find
	you get what you need O YEAAA

[2:32 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Hey you get off of my cloud!

[2:32 AM]
mmmeh:
	:steammocking:

[2:32 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	lol
	https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1620689054057364979/FFBD583320E8EBFBA9EF9FA66B180FA1309B3699/

	Lol strangest encounter of my life ^^^^^

[2:35 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol ayyy
	i was in cancun a few years and we visited some mayan ruins
	those lil lizard dudes were everywhere
	and really chill

[2:35 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Nice which one did you go to?
	I made the wise decision to go to one of the most remote ruins on one of the hottest days
	The heat nearly killed ne

[2:36 AM]
mmmeh:
	mm i think we went to Tulum
	and o ya u def need to be careful out there
	especially for a canadian like yourself, you'll melt!

[2:37 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Lolll :steammocking:
	We’re sensitive to heat and just about everything else
	Toronto does get very f#%&ing hot and humid though
	We can easily get around 30 Celsius in summer and -30 in winter :steamfacepalm:

[2:41 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol being from texas im no stranger to 30c, but -30 is just bonkers and i can't imagine what that could feel like
	probably burns more than 30c

[2:41 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	That without the windchill
	And were by the great lakes so lots of wind chill
	Feels like the colds slapping you in the face
	Do you have a fave philosopher?\

[2:46 AM]
mmmeh:
	mmmmmmmmmm probably Diogenes or Zeno of  Citium

[2:47 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Lol Diogenes
	What a character
	He’s classic
	Never heard of Zeno

[2:50 AM]
mmmeh:
	he's the sort of the father of stoicism

[2:51 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Nice
	I was always big fan of Greek philosophers
	But I lean more towards the epic tradition
	Homer, Sophocles, Hesiod
	But platos my favourite philosopher of that time

[2:52 AM]
mmmeh:
	plato really was the realest

[2:53 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	He had an interesting way of writing down his philosophy
	I think Plato for the most part was the genius behind Socrates as we know him
	His works border on the poetic

[3:05 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	I think I’m going to get baked

[3:05 AM]
mmmeh:
	lol rn?
	cheers
	when i smoke at night i find it impossible to fall asleep
	mind just races for hours

[3:11 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Yea me too I haven’t smoke in like 5 months
	Damn
	I start my python course on the 15th 🥳🥳🥳 I’m so excited
	Yo how would you suggest starting out when I learn to code

[3:14 AM]
mmmeh:
	woop woop!

[3:14 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	I’d like to work on some open source projects

[3:14 AM]
mmmeh:
	and hmm
	that's a solid goal
	but it can be pretty overwhelming
	id recommend using python to bring to life some data you find interesting
	or maybe use it to scrape a webpage
	for some information automatically or to download images

[3:15 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Ok sounds good

[3:15 AM]
mmmeh:
	really the possibilities are endless

[3:15 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	It does feel overwhelming

[3:15 AM]
mmmeh:
	the course will give you the tools

[3:15 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Knowing where to start

[3:15 AM]
mmmeh:
	but you need to whip out some creativity to build something with them
	but yes
	i def remember when i first started out
	with java
	ppl were pretty unforgiving on the internet and  expected u to just know everything from the start

[3:16 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Damn
	That’s not encouraging
	Id like to do some stuff eventually, to give back
	All those open source programs I used in my days
	I guess I took them for granted

[3:18 AM]
mmmeh:
	meh as long as you used them im sure the creators are happy 8)

[3:18 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Yeah that’s true
	Did you work on big projects before? What kinds of stuff did you do?
	Where did you start

[3:24 AM]
mmmeh:
	o the first big project i worked on was a lil pokemon-style game
	had a partner and we called it Or
	was really cool working with sprite animations and map/boss making
	after that i did just random  applications like a vowel counter or this one application that i would make draggable black bars
	bc this one movie pirating software i had (RIP popcorntime) refused to maximize and i didn't want to see my task bar or the application

[3:26 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Siiick!
	You had a movie pirating software? Nice what happened

[3:27 AM]
mmmeh:
	o eventually they got taken down
	it was the best tho
	full hd movies  and actually in english
	while they were still in theaters too sometimes

[3:28 AM]
Entancedpoet:
	Nice the successful ones do usually get taken down
	Nice though!

[1:53 PM]
mmmeh:
	oof
	finally i figured out what the issue was
	was using the wrong longitudes heh
	blue is what i was getting before and grey is what i have now, where orange is the target temperature
	https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1624066753787417729/242161ACAD56CDB0B309E74332C89F0E1CBC7535/

	pretty damn good !!

Entancedpoet:
	Damn son. Well done sir
	Sorry I got baked and passed out lol
	Want to play some rocket league
	My level on Xbox I’m only silver 3 and gold 1

[2:25 PM]
mmmeh:

	it's weird how when im high my urge to drink tanks

[2:29 PM]
Entancedpoet:

[3:22 PM]
mmmeh:
	dude

	like i actually got lsd visuals
	dots along my line of vision

[3:53 PM]
Entancedpoet:

	Watched potato league and laughed myself to sleep

[3:54 PM]
mmmeh:
	lol aw
	which was ur fav clip

[3:56 PM]
Entancedpoet:
	There was this one that was so funny where this was a bunch of whiffs and eventually there was an own goal. But they had that jstn rlcs goal commentary in the background
	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GJWdCL-obXU
	Lol that commentary
	I laughed so hard
	I don’t know why my messages are sending twice
	I’m on RL add my rocketid if you want
